# Arknights-Scraper

This repository contains a collection of Python scripts for scraping data about the mobile game Arknights from various sources and storing the data in a SQL database. The scraped data can then be easily accessed and queried using SQL.

# Requirements
- Python 3.6 or higher
- The following Python packages:
  - requests
  - bs4 (BeautifulSoup)
  - sqlalchemy
# Usage
To use the scraper, clone this repository and install the required packages using pip:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Then, run the `arknights_scraper.py` script to scrape the data and save it to a CSV file:


```
python arknights_scraper.py
```
This will scrape the data from the Arknights Wiki and the Arknights Database, and save the scraped data to a SQLite database called arknights_data.db. The database will contain the following tables:

# SQL Database Output
